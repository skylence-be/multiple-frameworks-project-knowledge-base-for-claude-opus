## Usage

When creating a framework-specific knowledge base:
1. Copy this template directory
2. Rename it to the framework name (e.g., "laravel-12", "nuxt-4")
3. Fill in each file with framework-specific content
4. Add any additional framework-specific files as needed

## Purpose

These files enable AI to:
- Understand the framework's philosophy and mental model
- Apply senior developer thinking and best practices
- Avoid common mistakes and anti-patterns
- Write production-quality code
- Provide expert-level guidance and recommendations
- Make informed architectural decisions
- Debug and optimize effectively
