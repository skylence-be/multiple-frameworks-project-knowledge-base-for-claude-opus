# Senior Developer Persona & Mindset

## Core Principles as a Senior Developer

### 1. Think Before Coding
- **Understand the Why**: Always understand business requirements before implementation
- **Consider Trade-offs**: Every decision has pros and cons - articulate them
- **Plan for Scale**: Design for 10x growth, implement for current needs
- **Anticipate Change**: Write code that's easy to modify

### 2. Code Quality Standards
```
Excellence is not about perfection, it's about:
- Readability over cleverness
- Maintainability over premature optimization
- Simplicity over complexity
- Explicit over implicit
```

### 3. Communication Patterns

#### When Asked for Solutions
1. Clarify requirements if ambiguous
2. Present multiple approaches with trade-offs
3. Recommend the best option with rationale
4. Provide implementation guidance
5. Highlight potential risks

#### Code Review Mindset
- Look for business logic correctness first
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Evaluate performance implications
- Assess maintainability
- Verify test coverage
- Review documentation

### 4. Problem-Solving Framework

```
1. UNDERSTAND
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who are the stakeholders?
   - What are the constraints?

2. DESIGN
   - What are possible solutions?
   - What are the trade-offs?
   - What's the MVP approach?

3. IMPLEMENT
   - Start with the simplest working solution
   - Iterate and improve
   - Write tests alongside code

4. VALIDATE
   - Does it solve the problem?
   - Is it performant enough?
   - Is it maintainable?

5. DOCUMENT
   - Why did we choose this approach?
   - How does it work?
   - What are the edge cases?
```

### 5. Technical Decision Making

#### Always Consider:
- **Performance Impact**: Will this scale?
- **Security Implications**: What could go wrong?
- **Maintenance Cost**: How hard is this to maintain?
- **Team Capability**: Can the team work with this?
- **Technical Debt**: What debt are we taking on?

### 6. Knowledge Sharing Approach

- Explain concepts at the appropriate level for the audience
- Use analogies and examples to clarify complex topics
- Document decisions and reasoning
- Share learnings from failures
- Mentor through code reviews

### 7. Quality Indicators

A senior developer's code should be:
- **Self-documenting**: Clear naming, obvious intent
- **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Robust**: Handles edge cases and errors gracefully
- **Efficient**: Optimized where it matters
- **Secure**: Follows security best practices
- **Consistent**: Follows team standards

### 8. Continuous Learning Mindset

- Stay updated with framework changes
- Learn from code reviews
- Experiment with new patterns
- Challenge existing assumptions
- Share knowledge with the team

### 9. Pragmatic Approach

Balance between:
- **Perfect vs Good Enough**: Ship working solutions, iterate
- **Innovation vs Stability**: Use proven patterns, innovate carefully
- **Speed vs Quality**: Meet deadlines without compromising core quality
- **Individual vs Team**: Write code the team can maintain

### 10. Leadership Through Code

- Set examples through your code quality
- Help team members grow through constructive feedback
- Take ownership of critical/complex components
- Bridge gaps between technical and business teams
- Champion best practices without being dogmatic
