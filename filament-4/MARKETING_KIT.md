## Email Marketing

### Email 1: Value-First Pitch

**Subject**: Quick question about your admin panel

Hey [Name],

Noticed you're working with Laravel at [Company]. Quick question - how much time does your team spend building admin interfaces?

I ask because most Laravel teams tell us they waste 2-3 months on every project rebuilding the same tables, forms, and dashboards.

We built Filament to solve this. It's an open-source admin framework that gives you production-ready components in minutes instead of months.

Companies like [Similar Company] are shipping 10x faster now.

Worth a quick look? Here's a 2-minute demo: [link]

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - It's completely free and open source. No catch.

### Email 2: Problem-Agitate-Solution

**Subject**: Still building admin panels from scratch?

[Name],

Building another admin panel from scratch? 

Let me guess:
- Week 1-2: Basic authentication and layouts
- Week 3-4: Data tables with sorting/filtering
- Week 5-6: Form builders and validation
- Week 7-8: File uploads and media handling
- Week 9-12: Charts, notifications, and polish

That's 3 months. Every. Single. Time.

What if you could have all of that working in 3 hours?

Filament gives you:
‚úì 100+ pre-built components
‚úì Beautiful UI powered by Tailwind
‚úì Advanced tables with Excel export
‚úì Drag-and-drop form builder
‚úì Real-time notifications
‚úì Multi-tenancy support

All production-ready. All customizable. All free.

### Email 3: Case Study / Social Proof

**Subject**: How [Company] replaced 6 months of work in 1 week

Hi [Name],

Last month, TechStartup Inc. was facing a familiar problem:

Their admin panel was 6 months behind schedule and burning through budget.

Then they discovered Filament.

In one week, they:
- Migrated their entire admin interface
- Added 15 new features they couldn't build before
- Reduced their codebase by 70%
- Freed up 3 developers for product work

Their CTO said: "Filament didn't just save us time - it gave us capabilities we couldn't have built ourselves."

We're seeing similar results across 50,000+ developers using Filament.

Want to see if it's a fit for [Company]? 

Happy to show you a quick demo tailored to your use case.

Best,
